    """Dynamic spike finder for intracellular voltage data.

    Intracellular recordings present some special challenges for detecting
    spikes. The data are not centered, and spike waveforms can change over the
    course of stimulation. The approach here is to use the first spike in the
    recording, which is typically the largest and has the best-defined onset, to
    set the threshhold for the window discriminator.

    `n_rise`: the approximate rise time of the spikes to be detected, in samples
    `n_before`: the number of samples before the spike peaks to analyze/extract
    `n_after`: the number of samples after the spike peaks to analyze/extract
